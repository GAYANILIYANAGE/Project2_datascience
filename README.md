# Mini Project II – Students Performance  

## Project description  
The data was collected from a fully online nine-week-long course on machine learning, hosted on the online learning management system Moodle. The goal of this project is to use two different supervised learning approaches (of your choice) to predict students’ final grade in an online course. 
## Data description  
The dataset contained anonymized informa on rela ng to 107 enrolled students. The data included students’ grades (from 3 mini projects, 3 quizzes and 3 peer reviews and the final overall grade) as well as the course logs. The deadline for the three mini projects fell within weeks 3, 5 and 8 of the course, whereas the deadline for the quizzes fell within weeks 2, 4 and 8.
